My first repository 

Hello People!

I'm Karnveer and I am studying electrical engineering but I have found myself being more and more drawn towards software!  This is my first time working with git and I think it's a pretty valuable skill to have under my belt.  My favorite languages to work in right now is probably c, matlab, then python.  But I would really like to build up my python skill over time with self studying and projects!
